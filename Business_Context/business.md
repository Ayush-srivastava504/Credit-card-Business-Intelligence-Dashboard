# Business Context & Value

## Business Problem

Financial institutions generate massive volumes of credit card customer and transaction data every day.  
However, without a centralized analytical view, this data remains underutilized, leading to:

- Limited visibility into **customer profitability**
- Ineffective **marketing and segmentation strategies**
- Delayed identification of **revenue drivers and spending patterns**
- Suboptimal product and pricing decisions

There is a clear need for interactive dashboards that convert raw transactional data into actionable insights.
